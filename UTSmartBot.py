UTS programmes are due for full accreditation when the first cohort of students of each programme reaches its final semester.  A few of UTS’ programmes have already received MQA’s Full Accreditation, and the rest have also been granted Provisional Accreditation.  UTS is confident to receive Full Accreditation for all its programmes when they are due.\nApproval by MOHE and MQA Provisional Accreditation – What does this mean?\nAll of UTS programmes must be approved by MOHE before it can be conducted.  This is a requirement under the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996.  All of UTS’ programmes have also obtained MQA Provisional Accreditation prior to the commencement of the programmes.  Having Provisional Accreditation means that the programme has met the minimum MQA requirements for UTS to start conducting the programme.\nMQA Full Accreditation/MQR/ PSD Recognition:\nWhen a programme obtains full accreditation by MQA and it would be registered under the Malaysian Qualifications Register (MQR).  All programmes listed in the MQR are recognised by the Public Service Department (PSD / JPA).  Graduates with MQA recognised degrees can proceed with their post-graduate studies in the Public Higher Education Institutions (PHEI) if they wish to do so.\nHow does MQA carry out the accreditation process?\nGenerally, a programme will be considered due for accreditation when the first cohort students are at the final or 2nd last semester of the programme.  The MQA Panel Assessors will then proceed to carry out the audit of that particular programme.  Upon complying with all the MQA requirements, MQA will inform UTS that Full Accreditation has been granted to that particular programme.\nWhat is Provisional Accreditation?\nIt is an exercise by MQA to determine whether a programme has met the minimum quality requirements to start conducting the programme.\nWhat is Full Accreditation?\nIt is an assessment exercise by MQA (with Professional Bodies if required by the programme) to ascertain that the teaching, learning and all other related activities of a programme provided by a higher education provider has met the quality standards and in compliance with the Malaysian Qualifications Framework (MQF).\nHow to check the programmes that have obtained full MQA accreditation are listed in the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA)?\nVisit the MQR webpage (www2.mqa.gov.my/mqr/). Please use the name “University of Technology Sarawak “instead of “UTS” when searching for the MQA full accreditation listings.\nHow to check the provisional accredited programmes?\nProvisional accredited programmes are listed separately under this webpage url: www2.mqa.gov.my/pasp/.

She was succeeded by Professor Dr. Salfarina Abdul Gapor in 2018. In 2019, Assoc. Professor Dr. Rabuan took over the directorship of CQA and continued with the tradition. Centre for Quality Assurance is committed to ensure continuous quality improvement and high quality of teaching and learning through its vision, mission and principle. \nUTS academic programmes have been developed in close collaboration with the industries and based on industrial needs. Initially, UTS started with four schools and offered only six academic programmes, two at foundation levels and four at undergraduate levels. These are Foundations in Art and Foundation in Science under the School of Foundation Studies. The School of Business and Management offered Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Accountancy, while the School of Engineering and Technology offered Bachelor of Engineering Technology in Electrical and Electronic and Civil Engineering. The School of Built Environment initially only offered Bachelor of Quantity Surveying.\nIn 2014, more Bachelor programmes were offered including Architecture, Network Computing, Software Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. In 2015, Electrical Engineering and Food Technology were offered.\nThe School of Postgraduate Studies was formed in 2016, marking a huge milestone for UTS, whereby five postgraduate programmes were introduced, two at PhD level by research and two at Master level by research, of which both are under Business Management and Engineering. Master of Business Administration was offered through coursework in 2016. In 2018, two more Master by coursework were offered – Master of Project Management and Master of Architecture. In 2019, two more Research programmes were offered – Master of Science in Applied Sciences and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Applied Sciences.\nIn 2020, School of Computing and Creative Media introduced two programmes at postgraduate level which are Master and PhD in Computing as well as two programmes at undergraduate level – Bachelor of Arts in Industrial Design and Bachelor of Arts in Creative Media. On the quarter fourth of year 2021, School of Built Environment introduced Bachelor of Arts in Interior Design. Both schools expected to offer another six programmes at Degree, Master and PhD level in year 2023.\nMission:\n•\tProviding conducive working and learning environment for the students and staff\n•\tPromoting high student engagements\n•\tSupporting student development and alumni\n•\tEnsuring quality teaching and learning\nCQI Plan\n1. Teaching Assessment\nTeaching Assessment is conducted at every end of each semester in order to get feedbacks from the students on the effectiveness of teaching and learning for the purpose of:\n•\tMonitoring the academic staff based on the set criteria\n•\tImproving the quality of courses and teaching skills of academic staff\n•\tGrooming and sustaining the academic staff to be capable and competent\n•\tProviding avenue for students’ feedbacks and identify necessary actions taken based on empirical data\n2. Curriculum Review\nCurriculum Review is carried out at every end of each semester and conducted within ten days after the final results have been approved by the Senate. It is done based on reviews of qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data include Course Coordinator’s reflections of the course’s content and flow, comments from the External Examiner(s), comments from the Industrial Advisory Panel (IAP), comments during Student Dialogue or other qualitative data relevant or related to the course. Quantitative data includes Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) attainment and student workloads in relation to the Student Learning Time (SLT). Curriculum Review Meetings are chaired by the Head of Programme and a report will suggest any necessary amendments of individual course’s learning outcomes, syllabus, and assessment strategy as well as teaching methodology.\n3. Exit Survey\nExit Survey is conducted after the graduation of every cohort of a programme, depending on the duration of the programme, commonly after 3 or 4 years. The respondents for this survey are the graduates. The purpose of the Exit Survey is to identify students’ views of the programme and their assessments and ratings of the overall achievement of the Programme Learning Outcomes (PLOs). Findings from the survey will be analysed and Head of Programmes (HOPs) are responsible to take necessary actions based on the findings.\n4.

School of Postgraduate Studies (SPS)\nFor more information, please refer to https://sps.uts.edu.my/\nAbout Us:\nPostgraduate study is study to a level that is higher than a first degree.  The reasons for pursuing a postgraduate degree are diverse and usually driven by personal needs and desires. Improving employment and salary prospects is not the only reason to pursue further study. People also undertake postgraduate study to specialize after doing a more generalize undergraduate degree, to gain profession registration, and to increase their depth of knowledge and expertise in their chosen field – so they can go on to do high-level work that is simulating, challenging, and ultimately more rewarding.\nProgramme Offered: \n1.
